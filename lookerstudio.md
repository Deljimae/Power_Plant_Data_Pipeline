# üîç Looker Studio Dashboard (Connected via Google Sheets from Athena Query Results)
Overview
Since Looker Studio does not directly support AWS Athena, we used the following workflow:

Ran SQL queries in Athena

Downloaded the results as CSV

Uploaded the data into Google Sheets

Connected Google Sheets to Looker Studio

This enabled us to leverage Looker Studio‚Äôs powerful visualization features for building interactive dashboards.
